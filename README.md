# Scholar-Desk-Exhibit

We are trying to recreate the Scholars Exhibit in the Chicago Field Musuem. Currently, we feel like the exhibit is not interactive 
enough therefore we want to incorproate tangible interaction into the exhibit to make it more interesting. We built a HTML5 canvas surface top
in order for visitors to have a chance to learn about Chinese Calligraphy. One of our design prototypes is to have a animated gif on the side for the
visitors to follow. Our second design prototype is to have visitors follow a dotted line for real time guidance.
